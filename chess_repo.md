# Chess Basics for Beginners

Chess is a 2-player game that utilizes a chessboard and sixteen pieces of 6 types for each player. See Wikipedia for a basic history of the game of chess.

## Object of the Game

To win a chess match, a player must use their chess pieces to create a situation where the opponent's king is unable to make a move to avoid capture.

## The Chessboard

A chessboard consists of 64 square spaces in an 8x8 grid. The squares are arranged in two alternating colors (light and dark). Sixteen "light" and sixteen "dark" pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in each player's near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called *ranks* and vertical rows are called *files*.

## The Chess Pieces

In a standard game of chess, each of the two players begins a game with the following 16 pieces:

## Initial Setup

At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged, one on a square, as follows:

- The 2 rooks are placed on the outside corners, right and left edge.
- The 2 knights are placed immediately inside of the rooks.
- The 2 bishops are placed immediately inside of the knights.
- The queen is placed on the central square of the same color of that of the player (white queen on the white square and black queen on the black square).
- The king takes the vacant spot next to the queen.
- The 8 pawns are placed one square in front of all of the other pieces.

## Gameplay

The player controlling the light pieces is usually named "White", while the player controlling the dark pieces is usually named "Black". White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required. It is not legal to skip a move, even when it is detrimental to move. Play continues until a king is *checkmated*, a player forfeits, or a *draw* is declared.

## Movement

Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement. A piece moves to a vacant square except when capturing an opponent's piece.

Except for any move of the knight and *castling*, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is *captured* (or *taken*) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square. The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.

Note: The king can be put *in check* but cannot be captured.

### Movement possibilities for each piece:

#### King

- The king can move **one** space at a time vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The king is not used as an attacking piece (except perhaps at the very end of the game) because, since he is so valuable, you want to keep him protected and out of harm's way. Nonetheless, he is capable of attacking any of the opposing pieces except the king and queen, to which he cannot get close enough to capture.
- Kings are not offensive pieces. Your king is the piece you most want to protect, because if you lose him, you lose the game.

#### Queen

- The queen is the most powerful piece on the board. She can be thought of as the **rook and bishop combined.** The queen can move any number of vacant squares *horizontally, vertically or diagonally*.
- Attacking with a queen is the same as with rooks and bishops. That is, she captures an opponent's piece that lies within her path by moving to that piece's square.

#### Bishop

- Bishops may move any number of vacant squares in any **diagonal** direction. Like rooks, they may capture an opponent's piece within its path by stopping on that piece's square.
- The bishop proceeds, lands, and captures diagonally and remains throughout the game on the same color squares on which it begins the game. Thus, each player has a white-square bishop and a dark-square bishop.
- As with rooks, if another of your pieces blocks your bishop's path, the bishop must stop before reaching the occupied square. If the blocking piece belongs to your opponent, you may stop on (but not jump over) that square and capture the occupying piece.

#### Knight

- Knights are the **only pieces that can jump** over other pieces and thus are the only pieces that cannot be blocked. They move in an L-shaped pattern. That is, two squares horizontally or vertically and then one square perpendicular to that (in other words, two spaces horizontally and one space vertically or one space horizontally and two spaces vertically).
- A knight captures a piece only when it lands on that piece's square. In other words, the knight can "jump" over other pieces (of either color) and capture a piece where it lands.

#### Rook

- Rooks may move *any* number of vacant squares *vertically* or *horizontally*. If an opponent's piece blocks the path, that piece may be captured by moving the rook to (but not beyond) the occupied square and removing the opponent's piece.
- Rooks cannot jump over pieces of either color. If one of your other pieces blocks your rook's path, your rook must stop before reaching that square.
- *Castling* is a special move involving a rook and a king.

#### Pawn

- Usually pawns move forward (never backward) one square. However, the first time it moves, a pawn may move forward either one or two squares. In all subsequent moves, a pawn is limited to moving one square at a time.
- If an opponent's piece is directly in front of it, a pawn may not move forward and may not capture that piece.
- A pawn may attack an opponent's piece only if the piece is one square *diagonally* forward from the pawn.
- *Pawn promotion* occurs when your pawn has marched all the way across the board to the eighth (your opponent's first) rank.

## Castling

*Castling* consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it. Castling is only permissible if **ALL** of the following conditions are true:

- The king and rook involved in castling have not previously been moved.
- There are no pieces between the king and the rook.
- The king is not currently *in check*. Note that the king cannot pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square).
- The rook did not become a rook from the promotion of a pawn.

## Pawn Promotion

If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then *promoted* (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player. The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence, it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted.

## Check and Checkmate

A king is *in check* when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece that is unable to move because it would place its own king *in check* may still *check* the opposing player.

It is illegal to make a move that places or leaves one's king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:

- *Move* the king to a square where it is not *in check*.
- *Capture* the checking piece (possibly with the king).
- *Block* the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece.

If it is not possible to get out of check, the king is **checkmated** and the game is over.

## Draws

The game ends in a *draw* if any of these conditions occur:

- The player is not in check but has no legal move.
- There is no possibility of *checkmate* for either side with any series of legal moves.
- Both players agree to a draw.
