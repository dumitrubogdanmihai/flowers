            <p>They are evergreen shrubs and small trees growing to 1–15 metres (3.3–49 ft) tall.
                The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three or four, 5–50 centimetres (2.0–20 in)
                long and 3–25 centimetres (1.2–9.8 in) broad, dark green and glossy with a leathery
                texture. The flowers are solitary or in small clusters, white, or pale yellow, with
                a tubular-based corolla with 5-12 lobes (petals) from 5–12 centimetres (2.0–4.7 in)
                diameter. Flowering is from about mid-spring to mid-summer and many species are
                strongly scented.</p>
            <p><b>Gardenia</b> plants are prized for the strong sweet scent of their flowers, which
                can be very large in some species.</p>
            <p><b>Gardenias</b> have a reputation for being difficult to grow. Because they
                originated in warm humid tropical areas, they demand high humidity to thrive. They
                flourish in acidic soils with good drainage and thrive on [68-74 F temperatures
                (20-23 C)] during the day and 60 F (15-16 C) in the evening. Potting soils developed
                especially for gardenias are available.</p>
            <p>In Japan and China, <b>Gardenia jasminoides</b> is called <i>Kuchinashi</i>
                (Japanese) and <i>Zhi zi</i> (Chinese); the bloom is used as a yellow dye, which is
                used for clothes and food (including the Korean mung bean jelly called
                hwangpomuk).</p>

            <p><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</i></p>
            <p><b>Snowdrop</b> is the common name for members of the genus <b>Galanthus</b>, a small
                genus of about 20 species in the family <b>Amaryllidaceae</b>; snowdrops are among
                the first bulbs to bloom in spring, although certain species flower in late autumn
                and winter.</p>

            <p><b>Galanthus nivalis</b> is the best-known and most widespread representative of the
                genus <b>Galanthus</b>. It is native to a large area of Europe, stretching from the
                Pyrenees in the west, through France and Germany to Poland in the north, Italy,
                Northern Greece and European Turkey. It has been introduced and is widely
                naturalised elsewhere. Although it is often thought of as a British native wild
                flower, or to have been brought to the British Isles by the Romans, it was probably
                introduced around the early sixteenth century.</p>
            <p>All species of <b>Galanthus</b> are perennial, herbaceous plants which grow from
                bulbs. The flower has no petals: it consists of six tepals, the outer three being
                larger and more convex than the inner series. An important feature which helps to
                distinguish between species (and to help to determine the parentage of hybrids) is
                their "<i>vernation</i>" (the arrangement of the emerging leaves relative to each
                other). This can be "<i>applanate</i>", "<i>supervolute</i>" or
                "<i>explicative</i>". In <i>applanate vernation</i> the two leaf blades are pressed
                flat to each other within the bud and as they emerge; explicative leaves are also
                pressed flat against each other, but the edges of the leaves are folded back or
                sometimes rolled; in <i>supervolute</i> plants one leaf is tightly clasped around
                the other within the bud and generally remains at the point where the leaves emerge
                from the
                soil<?oxy_comment_start author="John" timestamp="20120510T122717+0300" comment="We could add a phrase with information about snowdrop propagation."?>.<?oxy_comment_end?></p>
