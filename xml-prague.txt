Oxygen Content Fusion Pssssssss

One of the most interesting new features added in Oxygen Content Fusion is the new Projects feature, which allows you to manage a DITA project hosted in a Git repository while maintaining full compatibility with existing workflows and tools.
Authors can create review ssssssssssssssstasks inside a project and reviewers' feedback is tracked on a dedicated branch in the Git repository.
New publishing features help authors build WebHelp and PDF outputs, and the Oxygen Styles Basket has been integrated to make it very easy to customize the output using CSS styling.
